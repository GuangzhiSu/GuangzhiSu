This repository contains the research files for the SAIF project. The materials include Jupyter notebooks hosted on Google Colab, LaTeX source files for the research paper, and the compiled PDF of the final document.

## Contents

- **Google Colab Notebooks**: Interactive Python notebooks used for data analysis and visualization.
- **LaTeX Files**: Source files used to compile the research paper.
- **Compiled PDF**: The final output of the LaTeX files, presenting the research findings.
