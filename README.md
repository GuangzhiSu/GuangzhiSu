## Repository Introduction
This GitHub repository is dedicated to housing my responses and solutions to Problem Set 1 for the **COMPSCI/ECON 206 Computational Microeconomics** class, taught by **Prof. Luyao Zhang** at DKU. It is structured to not only showcase my solutions to the intricate problems posed in the class but also to highlight my personal methodology, insights, and the innovative strategies I employed. Through the organization of each folder and file, visitors can trace my thought process and proficiency in applying computational techniques and economic theory to solve complex microeconomic problems.

# CS/Econ 206: Computational Microeconomics - My Journey

## Intellectual Growth
In CS/Econ 206, my intellectual landscape has expanded by integrating game theory with cutting-edge technologies such as AI, Blockchain, LLM, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. The course has deepened my understanding of how machine learning can address complex social and economic issues by providing new methods for analysis and solution generation. The "magic" of interdisciplinary research, particularly evident in this course, lies in its ability to combine diverse methodologies and insights, which often leads to innovative solutions that would not be possible within a single field. This synthesis not only enhances theoretical frameworks but also improves the applicability and effectiveness of technological solutions in real-world scenarios.

## Professional Growth
This course has been instrumental in my professional development, enabling me to acquire a robust combination of technical and analytical skills. Learning to apply AI and machine learning to economic models has prepared me for a career where technology and economic strategy converge. I have developed a professional profile that is unique in its ability to straddle technology and economic analysis, making me well-suited for roles in data science, economic policy-making, or technology strategy. This skill set is crucial for modern economies where digital transformation dictates market dynamics.

## Living a Purposeful Life
Looking forward, I aspire to be a pioneering figure in the integration of machine learning with economic theory, contributing to the development of more equitable and efficient market systems. If I were to win a Nobel Prize or Turing Award, I imagine the feature sentence might say:

"Recognized for groundbreaking contributions to Computational Economics, particularly for developing innovative machine learning models that significantly improve market efficiency and equity."

My ultimate contribution to advancing human civilization would be to create frameworks that not only enhance economic efficiency but also promote social equity. By pursuing these multi-objective solutions, my work aims to not only fulfill my personal ambitions but also to significantly benefit society by harnessing the potential of technology for the greater good.
