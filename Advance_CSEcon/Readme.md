### Question 1: Beyond Computer Science and Economics Methodology 1 Behavioral Game Theory and Mechanism Design: Innovating Behavioral Game Theory Tools

**Question:** Analyze your experience with oTree, identifying pain points in behavioral game theory research. Review related literature and class discussions to understand experimental economics' goals. Propose a software solution that outperforms oTree in at least three aspects, enhancing strategic interaction studies. Highlight why these advancements are crucial. Submit a concise essay question answer (500 words max) with your analysis and proposals, backed by literature and class insights. Your innovative ideas can significantly contribute to experimental economics, addressing current limitations and paving the way for advanced research methodologies.

**Answer:** Experimental economics has greatly benefited from advancements in software technologies, with platforms like oTree leading the charge in facilitating behavioral game theory research. However, based on the journey with deploying the trust game using oTree in the class, critical pain points that hinder its wider adoption, especially among those without a computer science background were revealed. The necessity to run complex commands in a terminal to execute an otreezip file stands out as a significant barrier, deterring engagement and potentially skewing research participation towards those with technical prowess.

Therefore, I propose two software solutions envisioned to excel over oTree in three critical aspects:

1. **Integrated Tutorial System:** While oTree provides download guidance, featuring a one-click download option and installation instructions, it falls short in offering comprehensive tutorials on terminal use—a skill many economics students find challenging. A more user-friendly approach would involve the provision of detailed, step-by-step guides or video tutorials on the website to assist users through the process.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A more user-friendly way is to design a GUI for experiment set up and deployment. A drag-and-drop interface for designing experiments and a one-click deployment solution would eliminate the need for terminal commands. This approach not only lowers the entry barrier for non-technical users but also speeds up the process of experiment iteration and testing, fostering a more inclusive research community.

A second aspect to enhance the experience is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents as players within the experimental platform. We can accomplish this by these two methods:

1. **AI Strategy Library:** A comprehensive library of pre-defined AI strategies relevant to different game theory models (e.g., tit-for-tat in repeated prisoner's dilemma, risk-averse/risk-seeking behaviors, etc.) that can be easily selected and customized by researchers for their experiments.

2. **Custom AI Development Kit:** For more advanced users, the software will offer tools to develop custom AI agents using scripting languages like Python. This kit will provide APIs for integrating these custom agents directly into the experimental platform, allowing for unique and novel game theory experiments.

The ability to incorporate AI players introduces a new dimension to experimental economics, enabling the study of human interaction with automated agents—a scenario increasingly relevant in the digital economy. Also, it opens up avenues for research in areas such as algorithmic trading, automated negotiation, and the exploration of human trust in AI decision-making.

### Question 2: Beyond Computer Science and Economics Methodology 2 Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning: Advancing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

**Question:** Delve into the limitations of current multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks, focusing on environment constraints and agent algorithm customizations. Choose a classic game (e.g., Prisoner's Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes, or the Trust Game) to illustrate these limitations. Describe the development process of a MARL agent for your selected game, detailing the definition of states, actions, and rewards grounded in fundamental behavioral assumptions. Your analysis should provide insights into overcoming MARL's current limitations, fostering advancements in the field. Submit a comprehensive report (500 words max) with your findings and proposals.

**Answer:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands as a frontier in artificial intelligence, aiming to navigate and master complex environments through the interaction of multiple agents. Despite its innovative approach, MARL is hampered by significant challenges, particularly when applied to complex scenarios such as the game of Go on a 19x19 board. This game, known for its deep strategic complexity and vast number of possible states, serves as an exemplary domain to explore the limitations of current MARL frameworks, including environment constraints and agent algorithm customizations.

### Question 3: Brainstorm your research idea by criticizing existing research: Critiquing and Expanding upon Existing Research

**Objective:** The goal of this assignment is to engage critically with existing research in the field of federated learning, using the specific paper presented by the guest speaker as a primary example. Students will assess the paper's research questions, methodologies, and application scenarios and propose new research ideas addressing the identified limitations or gaps.

**Answer:**

1. **Summary of the Paper**
   - **Core Research Questions:** The paper investigates designing an incentive mechanism for Federated Learning (FL) to promote varied client participation, aiming for an unbiased global model. It challenges traditional FL models' bias by using a game-theoretic approach with a customized pricing strategy to encourage diverse client involvement. The research primarily seeks to create a fair incentive system that ensures model accuracy and devises a payment strategy reflecting clients' contributions. This approach aims to improve model performance and client profit by addressing data heterogeneity and system constraints.
